# Bank System

This is a simple banking that I created in C++. It allows you to create an account(s), login, deposit, withdraw, and check your Account Balance.

## Features 

- User Authentication: You can create an account with a username and password, and login from there.
- Account Actions: Once the correct login goes through, you can deposit, withdraw, and check the account balance.
- Saved information: Account information is saved to a file so that you can access you accounts even after closing the program.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable file.
3. Choose between logging in, creating a new account, or exiting the program.
4. If creating a new account, choose a unique username and password.
5. If logging in, enter your username and password.
6. Once logged in, choose from the available actions (check balance, deposit, withdraw, logout).
7. When finished, choose to logout to save your account information.

## Files

- `banking.cpp`: The main C++ source code file containing the implementation of the banking system.
- `accounts.txt`: A text file where account information (username, password, balance) is stored.

## Dependencies
